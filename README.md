## Description

An in-depth approach to best practices for GitHub and Django Rest Framework

### Disclaimer

* Keep in mind that these are only guidelines and there will be times where breaking them will make sense.
* The most important thing is to write code that is clear, concise, and maintainable, and that meets the needs of your application and users.

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

## Django Rest Framework (DRF)

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
1.	Use class-based views instead of function-based views.
2.	Follow the PEP 8 style guide for code formatting and style conventions.
3.	Use serializers to handle the serialization and deserialization of data.
4.	Use ViewSets and Routers to map URLs to views and reduce boilerplate code.
5.	Use pagination to handle large datasets and improve performance.
6.	Use permissions and authentication to control access to your API endpoints.
7.	Use filters, ordering, and searching to provide flexible querying of your data.
8.	Use testing to verify the functionality of your API and catch bugs early.
9.	Use HTTP status codes appropriately to communicate the status of requests and responses.
10.	Use versioning to handle changes to your API over time.
